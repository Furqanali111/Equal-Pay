# Equal-Pay
# Introduction
Gender pay gap refers to the difference in earnings between men and women in the workforce, and it has been a persistent problem in many countries worldwide, including Pakistan. Despite the advances made in recent years to promote gender equality in the workplace, women continue to earn less than men for the same job, qualifications, and experience. The gender pay gap not only affects women's financial security, but it also perpetuates social and economic inequalities, making it a pressing issue that needs to be addressed.
In this report, we will present the EqualPay project, developed by the TechBridge team, to provide a solution to the gender pay gap in Pakistan. Our project aims to develop a mobile application called EqualPay, which will help people negotiate for fair pay and raise awareness about the issue. We will provide an overview of our project, including the problem statement, legal frameworks related to gender pay, our SLDC approach using Agile methodology, the Figma-based prototype of the app, and our proposed solution. We will also discuss future enhancements and the potential impact of our solution on individuals and society as a whole.
# Problem Statement
The gender pay gap remains a persistent issue in many countries, including Pakistan. To address this problem, we have designed and developed an initial version of an app that aims to help individuals determine whether they are being underpaid due to their gender and provide guidance on how to negotiate for a raise. To inform the development of this app, we conducted a survey of the working class and graduate students in Pakistan to collect data on their views on the gender pay gap and their preferences for an app that addresses this issue.
